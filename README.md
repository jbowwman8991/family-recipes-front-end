# Family Recipes Front End 
This is an app that would allow families or a group of friends to share recipes with each other. There would be different options to write in your own recipe or to take a picture of a physical recipe and upload it. This would allow families and groups of friends to share their cooking experiences with each without having to be in the same place. It would also be a great way to store recipes that you like so that you wouldn't have to search through old cookbooks to find a recipe that was used before. A user could also be a part of more than one family or group to share more recipes with different people.

A shopping list feature could be added that would add the ingredients of a recipe to a shopping list so that it would be easy to find all the ingredients you would need. In addition to the shopping list feature, a meal planning feature could be added that would allow users to plan out their meals and coordinate their shopping trips effectively.
